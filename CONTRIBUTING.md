# Contributing
We are open to, and grateful for, any of your contributions.  By contributing to HiProxy, you agree to abide by the [code of conduct](https://github.com/reactjs/react-redux/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Reporting Issues and Asking Questions
Before opening an issue, please search the [issue tracker](https://github.com/hiproxy/hiproxy/issues) to make sure your issue hasn't already been reported.

### New Features

Please open an issue with a proposal for a new feature or refactoring before starting on the work. We don't want you to waste your efforts on a pull request that we won't want to accept.


## Steps for contributing
1. [Create an issue](https://github.com/hiproxy/hiproxy/issues/new) for the bug you want to fix or the feature that you want to add.
2. Create your own [fork](https://github.com/hiproxy/hiproxy) on github, then checkout your fork.
3. Write your code in your local copy. It's good practice to create a branch based off the `master` branch for each new issue you work on, although not compulsory.
4. To run the test suite, first install the dependencies by running `npm install`, then run `npm test`.
5. If the tests pass, you can commit your changes to your fork and then create a pull request from there. Make sure to reference your issue from the pull request comments by including the issue number e.g. `#123`.

Please try to keep your pull request focused in scope and avoid including unrelated commits.

After you have submitted your pull request, we'll try to get back to you as soon as possible. We may suggest some changes or improvements.

Thank you for contributing!
